1.The recent outbreak has prevented me from going out, and staying at home is the best and safest option. Without food and daily necessities, it can also go out instead of me. I just need to control it in front of the console.
2.Recently we discovered a planet with living creatures, probably the alien. We're curious about this, but we won't go to the survey in person, we have found substitutes. To prevent aliens from being hostile, we don't use human shapes on substitutes. Instead, based on the physical characteristics of each other, they will screen out the appearances that are most unsuspecting.
